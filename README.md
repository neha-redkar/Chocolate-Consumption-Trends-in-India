🍫 Chocolate Consumption Trends in India


📖 Project Overview

This project explores how consumers across India purchase and enjoy chocolates — analyzing demographics, behavioral patterns, and regional preferences.
It was developed using a synthetic dataset generated via ChatGPT to replicate realistic consumer data for hands-on analytics practice.

The goal of this project was to transform raw data into actionable insights through Python-based EDA and an interactive Power BI dashboard.



🧭 Objectives

Understand demographic trends in chocolate consumption.

Analyze behavioral and mood-driven spending patterns.

Study purchase frequency and occasion-based preferences.

Examine regional spending patterns and brand preferences.



⚙️ Project Workflow
Phase 1 – Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)
